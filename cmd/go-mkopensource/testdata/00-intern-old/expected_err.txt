1 license-detection error:
 1. Package "github.com/josharian/intern": could not identify a license for all sources (had no global LICENSE file)
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    Some possible causes for this issue are:

    - Dependency is proprietary software: Create a yaml file with the
    proprietary dependencies and pass it to the generate.sh script using
    the --proprietary-packages command line option.  See the README.md
    file for more information.

    - License information can't be identified: Add an entry to
    hardcodedGoDependencies, hardcodedPythonDependencies or
    hardcodedJsDependencies depending on the dependency that was not
    identified.

    For github.com/josharian/intern in particular, this probably means
    that you are depending on an old version; upgrading to intern
    v1.0.1-0.20211109044230-42b52b674af5 or later should resolve this.
