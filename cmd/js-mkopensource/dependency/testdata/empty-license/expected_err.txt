1 license-detection error:
 1. Dependency 'agent-base@6.0.2' is missing a license identifier.
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    Some possible causes for this issue are:

    - Dependency is proprietary software: Create a yaml file with the
    proprietary dependencies and pass it to the generate.sh script using
    the --proprietary-packages command line option.  See the README.md
    file for more information.

    - License information can't be identified: Add an entry to
    hardcodedGoDependencies, hardcodedPythonDependencies or
    hardcodedJsDependencies depending on the dependency that was not
    identified.
